# AntPathPlanning
Ant colony algorithm used for grid map path planning.

### Compile

```
cd AntPathPlanning
mkdir build
cmake ..
make
```

### Run

```
./AntPathPlanning
```

You can modify start point and destination point and obstacle points in the codes. Shortest path will print on the screen.

Note that this algorithm is not perfect, the path computed seems a little strange. Feel free to further optimize it :-)
